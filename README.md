# Basic algorithms in Clojure

This is a collection of data structures and algorithms that are essential and
not so essential in the modern era. You are free to use any of these without
any obligations.

Why reinvent the wheel, Clojure is built on some of these structures?! Haha, I
don't know.

# Available structures and algorithms

- [AVL tree][1] -- self-balancing binary search tree, O(log n) operations, on
  average faster than Red-Black tree on lookup but slower on modifications.
- [Binary search tree][2] -- most basic data structure. Also contains
  benchmarks on different implementations of the tree.
- [Red-Black tree][3] -- self-balancing binary search tree, O(log n)
  operations, on average faster than AVL tree on modifications but slower on
  lookup.
